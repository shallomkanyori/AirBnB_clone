									<p>Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house centrally located just minutes to French Quarters, downtown, the Fair Grounds (Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen, and living room. The extra high ceiling make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Meriot.</p>

											<h3>From Max the 27th January 2017</h3>
											<p>Fantastic place. It was clean, Adrienne was great (even though we did not meet in person) and everythin went super smooth. Location is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p>

											<h3>From Magdalene Forst the 10th August 2018</h3>

											<h3>From Eustace Amani the 3rd September 2018</h3>
											<p>An exceptional find! The $190 per night is a steal for such a well-furnished suite in this prime location. The cozy bedroom ensured a great night's sleep after a day of exploring. Highly recommended.</p>

											<h3>From Emily the 31st July 2019</h3>
											<p>Chose this suite for a weekend getaway, and it exceeded my expectations. The modern amenities and cleanliness were top-notch. Waking up to the sunrise over the city was magical. Will be back soon!</p>

											<h3>From Michael Jones the 9th May 2020</h3>
											<p>Booked this Airbnb suite for a business trip, and I couldn't have been happier. The convenient location near key landmarks was a bonus. The price of $190 per night is a fantastic deal given the level of luxury. Will recommend to colleagues.</p>
